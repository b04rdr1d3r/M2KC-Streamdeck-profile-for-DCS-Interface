####################################################################

a Mirage 2000C profile for use with DCS interface on a Stream Deck (c) Blue Storm & Bearcat 2021-2023

Version 1.2

a Mirage 2000 profile to be used with DCS Interface for Streamdeck

what you need:

* DCS 2.8.x
* the Mirage 2000C module by Razbam
* a Streamdeck preferably the XL since this is the one we focus on right now, but a legacy 15 button version is included
* (!! IMPORTANT !!) Make sure software version for the streamdeck is above 6.x otherwise some functions will not work correctly
* DCS Interface ==> https://github.com/charlestytler/streamdeck-dcs-interface
* DCS Interface requires DCS Exports Scripts (https://github.com/asherao/DCS-ExportScripts). I strongly suggest asherao's version (forked from s-d-a version but kept up-to-date) NB: Our M2000C.lua file has now been merged into asherao's base repository, but if you don't have the latest versions, things may break so I am including in the release the right file, just in case...
NB: please use the lua included unless you can confirm that asherao's version is in sync with ours (sometime it takes time to push the changes to asherao's version)

Once you have all DCS Export Scripts and DCS Interface running, just upload the profile and off you go...

What's new in this version: the EVF channel is now properly displayed, ergonomics, a completely revamped PPA panel, PCA bugfixes (and more !)

Our goal is to provide you with a tool that gives you access to all the functionalities, you can then rearrange at will according to your ergonomic preferences !

Please let me know any issue/bug you encounter and what you'd really want to have. hop on our discord here ==> https://discord.gg/9FtGbP846A
