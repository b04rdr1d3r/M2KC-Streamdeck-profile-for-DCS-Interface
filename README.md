# M2KC-Streamdeck-profile-for-DCS-Interface
Mirage 2000C profile for use with DCS interface on a Stream Deck

ALPHA version

This the first alpha release of a Mirage 2000 profile to be used with DCS Interface for Streamdeck

what you need:
- DCS
- the Mirage 2000C module by Razbam
- a streamdeck
- DCS Interface ==> https://github.com/charlestytler/streamdeck-dcs-interface
- DCS Interface requires DCS Exports Scripts (https://github.com/s-d-a/DCS-ExportScripts)
- DCS Export Scripts M-2000 module is not working properly, you'll need my version => https://github.com/b04rdr1d3r/DCS-ExportScripts/blob/master/Scripts/DCS-ExportScript/ExportsModules/M-2000C.lua

Once you have all DCS Export Scripts and DCS Interface running, just upload the profile and off you go...

What works:
Master Arm / PCA / PPA
Autopilot (basic functions)
Fuel Flow and Afterbhurner indicators
master caution indicator
Radio (only frequency display ATM)
PCN / INS (basic functions to enable you to align when on the ground)
TACAN frequency setting

What does not work well : VOR/ILS frequency setting)

Please let me know the bugs and what you'd like to see in the profile
