a Mirage 2000C profile for use with DCS interface on a Stream Deck (c) Blue Storm & Bearcat 2021-2024

Version 1.3

a Mirage 2000 profile to be used with DCS Interface for Streamdeck

what you need:

* DCS 2.9.x
* the Mirage 2000C module by Razbam
* a Streamdeck preferably the XL since this is the one we focus on right now, a legacy version exist, but is largely deprecated by now....
* (!! IMPORTANT !!) Make sure software version for the streamdeck is above 6.x otherwise some functions will not work correctly
* DCS Interface ==> https://github.com/charlestytler/streamdeck-dcs-interface
* DCS Interface requires DCS Exports Scripts (https://github.com/asherao/DCS-ExportScripts) or preferably ours (which is usually synced with asherao's but contains out of the box, our M2000C.mua file). alternatively, you can use asherao's and replace the M2000C.lua file with the one included in our package.

Once you have all DCS Export Scripts and DCS Interface running, just upload the profile and off you go...

What's new in this version: 
 - PCN export working again after the change introduced by Razbam (careful, some digits may display "@": it's not a bug, it's because your PCN display is malfunctionning in the sim...
   
Our goal is to provide you with a tool that gives you access to all the functionalities, you can then rearrange at will according to your ergonomic preferences !
