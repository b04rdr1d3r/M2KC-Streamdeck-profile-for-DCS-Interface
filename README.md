# M2KC-Streamdeck-profile-for-DCS-Interface
Mirage 2000C profile for use with DCS interface on a Stream Deck
(c) Blue Storm 2021

BETA version 0.9

This alpha release of a Mirage 2000 profile to be used with DCS Interface for Streamdeck

what you need:
- DCS 2.7 (2.7 version is required)
- the Mirage 2000C module by Razbam
- a streamdeck
- DCS Interface ==> https://github.com/charlestytler/streamdeck-dcs-interface
- DCS Interface requires DCS Exports Scripts (https://github.com/s-d-a/DCS-ExportScripts)
- DCS Export Scripts M-2000 module is not working properly, until this is corrected, you'll need to swap this my version with the one supplied by DCS Export Scipts (NOTA BENE : there are a few add-ons, bug corrections in that version)

Once you have all DCS Export Scripts and DCS Interface running, just upload the profile and off you go...

What's new in this version:
PCN fully made compatible with updates of version 2.7 and cleaned up to be prettier and more like the actual display
PCA corrected to work with 2.7
Engine needle (%age) now displayed as actual percentage instead of floating point number (and made white)
Added the jettison / selective jettison functions


What works:
Master Arm / PCA / PPA

master caution indicator
Radio frequency display / setting (except for UHF)
PCN / INS (basic functions to enable you to align when on the ground)
