# M2KC-Streamdeck-profile-for-DCS-Interface
Mirage 2000C profile for use with DCS interface on a Stream Deck
(c) Blue Storm & Bearcat 2021-2022

BETA version 1.1 coming shortly !!

a Mirage 2000 profile to be used with DCS Interface for Streamdeck

what you need:
- DCS 2.7.x
- the Mirage 2000C module by Razbam
- a streamdeck (the standard 15 buttons one or larger)
- DCS Interface ==> https://github.com/charlestytler/streamdeck-dcs-interface
- DCS Interface requires DCS Exports Scripts (https://github.com/s-d-a/DCS-ExportScripts)
- DCS Export Scripts M-2000 module is not working properly, until this is corrected, you'll need to swap this my version with the one supplied by DCS Export Scipts (NOTA BENE : there are a few add-ons, bug corrections in that version)

Once you have all DCS Export Scripts and DCS Interface running, just upload the profile and off you go...

What's new in this version:
many additions brought to you by Bearcat + some others by Blue Storm!

What works:
Gear lights / FBW switch
VTH display and selected switches
RWR lights and associated switches
Jettison selective / Emergency
Autopilot (basic functions)
Fuel Flow and Afterburner indicators / Fuel management (incl. bongo and detot)
master caution indicator panel
UHF / VHF radio => caution UHF radio selector not 100% effective
PCN / INS (basic functions to enable you to align when on the ground)
PSM => caution channel 10 tacan selector and decimal switch VOR/ILS not fully functional
Engine management + startup test switches (FBW + AP)
Caution / Warning Lights
External lights + internal lights (with pre-select intensity)
VTB including radar, DEC mode and TAF (no display of TAF channel though :-( )

What does not work well : VOR/ILS frequency setting / Tacan channel 10 selector / Radio UHF frequency setting

Please let me know any issue/bug you encounter and what you'd really want to have
