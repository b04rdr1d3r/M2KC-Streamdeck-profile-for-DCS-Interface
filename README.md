# M2KC-Streamdeck-profile-for-DCS-Interface
####################################################################

a Mirage 2000C profile for use with DCS interface on a Stream Deck (c) Blue Storm & Bearcat 2021-2022

Version 1.13

a Mirage 2000 profile to be used with DCS Interface for Streamdeck

what you need:

* DCS 2.8.x
* the Mirage 2000C module by Razbam
* a Streamdeck (the standard 15 buttons one works fine, but given how many functions are mapped, you may prefer an XL)
* DCS Interface ==> https://github.com/charlestytler/streamdeck-dcs-interface
* DCS Interface requires DCS Exports Scripts (https://github.com/asherao/DCS-ExportScripts). I strongly suggest asherao's version (forked from s-d-a version but kept up-to-date) NB: Our M2000C.lua file has now been merged into asherao's base repository, but if you don't have the latest versions, things may break so I am including in the release the right file, just in case...

Once you have all DCS Export Scripts and DCS Interface running, just upload the profile and off you go...

What's new in this version: HSI added, full support for the Autopilot lights, IFF, cokpit lighting, VTB illumination, reworked several pages to ensure 99% of functions are now adequately mapped AND we are now also offering an XL version !!

Our goal is to provide you with a tool that gives you access to all the functionalities, you can then rearrange at will according to your ergonomic preferences !

Please let me know any issue/bug you encounter and what you'd really want to have

M-2000 icon from Togg (currently linked to a menu profile... so you can switch to whatever you want) some icons borrowed from Ikarus => https://github.com/H-J-P/Ikarus and Helios => https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/releases/latest
